# Fantasy Word Hangman Game

## Instructions
Press any key to start.
The application will register what key is pressed, and compare it to the randomly chosen to word. If the letter exsists in the word, it will be displayed in the current word line.

If the letter is not in the current word, your remaining guesses will decrease and it will list the letter chosen in the letters guessed section.
The app will keep track of how many times you win or lose and will display them on the screen. 

The code contains primary styling from bootstrap, linked in the html.
I have also utilized Google Fonts, for the primary font.
I have used Font Awesome for icons.
